\chapter*{Preface}

Thanks to all the students that showed me there is always room for improvement.

In this 'thesis' I wrote down some of my annoyances in reading students work.

In several spots in this thesis I write 'I' or 'we', which is bad style in a normal thesis.
However, because I consider me, myself and my fellow teachers main stakeholders in all of your writing, I allow myself to do that here. \textit{Do not do that at home} (for your own thesis that is).
