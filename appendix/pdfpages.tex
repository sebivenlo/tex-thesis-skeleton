\chapter{Include using pdfpages}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
Include the whole pdf with all pages and some scale down to have our
own page numbering.
The pdf has been created from a website using the ``print to pdf''
feature of the \textbf{firefox} web browser which by the way has a
very nice pdf viewer with annotation features.
\lstset{language=[LaTeX]TeX}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={code to include next pages as pdf}]
\includepdf[scale=0.9,pages=-,pagecommand={\thispagestyle{appendix}}]{appendix/sausageisnotsteel.pdf}
\end{lstlisting}

If you make the documents intended for the appendix in \LaTeX\ too,
you should of course simply $\backslash$include them in your report,
as all but the last appendix here have been done.

\includepdf[scale=0.9,pages=-,pagecommand={\thispagestyle{appendix}}]{appendix/sausageisnotsteel.pdf}
